What if the answer to “where to live now” is actually “lots of places” and “kind of nowhere”? Kibbo is a new entry in the booming business of American life in vans. It rents vans to its members and also creates communities for them to engage with. It plans to start with five wilderness locations in which its vans can park. Its first, expected to open in September, include Ojai and Big Sur, in California; Zion, in Utah; and the Black Rock Desert in Nevada, home of Burning Man. These locations — you could call them campsites? Or … trailer parks? — have a central hub, or clubhouse, designed to feel like co-living space. There will be Wi-Fi, bathrooms, a kitchen with shared food. The other upside? Members lease these mobile homes, with all-access membership and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 4x4 cargo van rentals starting at about $1,500 per month. Marian Goodell, the C.E.O. of Burning Man, owns her San Francisco apartment but has been living in a borrowed Kibbo van for the past several weeks, test-driving the lifestyle.
