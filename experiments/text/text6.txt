SAN FRANCISCO — In April, Françoise Brougher, the chief operating officer of Pinterest and its top female executive, abruptly left the company with little explanation. In a lawsuit filed on Tuesday, Ms. Brougher accused the $21 billion company, which makes virtual pinboards, of firing her after she complained about sexist treatment. In her suit, which was filed in San Francisco Superior Court, Ms. Brougher said she had been left out of important meetings, was given gendered feedback, was paid less than her male peers when she joined the company, and ultimately was let go for speaking up about it. "Gender discrimination at the C-level suite may be a little more subtle, but it’s very insidious and real," Ms. Brougher, 54, said in an interview. "When men speak out, they get rewarded. When women speak out, they get fired." Pinterest was reviewing the lawsuit, a company spokeswoman said. “Our employees are incredibly important to us,” she said, adding that the company was committed to advancing its culture so "all of our employees feel included and supported."" Pinterest is conducting an independent review regarding its culture, policies and practices, she added.
