On Thursday, the Trump administration signed executive orders that seemed to seek a ban on two China-based smartphone apps, TikTok and WeChat, from operating in the United States or interacting with U.S. companies. This step was a long time coming, but it still felt surprising. The practical significance of these White House mandates and a similar State Department policy statement this week aren’t exactly clear yet. Two high-profile apps might be gone from the United States in 45 days, or not. But the philosophical implications are concerning.

And it can be hard for people to know if those rules are based on legitimate national security concerns or expressions of nationalism.
